## 1. Raw Data Derivation (update-data.ts)

Data comes from [nflverse](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data). The `scripts/update-data.ts` script fetches and transforms CSV data into the JSON format consumed by the app.

### 1.1 Snap Share (per season, per player)

**Source:** `snap_counts_{season}.csv` plus `players.csv` (`position_group`, `position` by `pfr_id`).

**Definition:** Average of a per-game share across games with snaps &gt; 0. The per-game share depends on whether the player is a special-teams specialist:

- **Kickers, punters, long snappers** (`position_group` = `SPEC`, or `position` is `K`, `P`, or `LS`):  
  `share[game] = max(offense_pct, defense_pct, st_pct)`
- **All other players:**  
  `share[game] = max(offense_pct, defense_pct)`  
  Special teams pct is omitted so positional players who mostly play ST (e.g. a safety with few defensive snaps) are not classified like full-time starters.

**Formula:**

```
For each game row where the player had snaps > 0:
  share[game] = per-game share (see above)

snapShare = (sum of share[game] for all games) / gamesPlayed
```

**Range:** 0.0–1.0 (unit share)

**Notes:**

- Including `st_pct` only for specialists matches contribution for K/P/LS while keeping role bands meaningful for offense/defense positions.
- If `pfr_id` is missing from `players.csv`, the non-specialist rule applies (conservative).
- Games with zero snaps are excluded; the player does not increment `gamesPlayed` for that week.

### 1.2 Season load share (cumulative, per season, per player)

**Purpose:** Role tier thresholds (65% / 35% / 10%) use this value so **missed games** reduce a player’s tier: inactive weeks add nothing to the numerator but the denominator still reflects the **full team season**.

**Numerator (`playerNum`):** For each game row with snaps &gt; 0, add player scrimmage snaps (offense + defense; kickers/punters/long snappers also add ST snaps), same rules as `playerSnapsForCumulativeLoad` in `src/lib/snapCountTotals.ts`.

**Denominator (single-franchise seasons):** Sum team snap capacity **for every game that franchise played** in that season (from `snap_counts`, one row per `(game_id, team)`):

- **Non-specialists:** Sum of `team_offense_snaps + team_defense_snaps` per game (from percentages on any row for that game).
- **Specialists (K, P, LS / SPEC):** Sum of scrimmage capacity **plus** team special-teams capacity per game (so numerator and denominator stay comparable).

Franchise codes are normalized (`src/lib/nflverseFranchise.ts`). Let `teamSeasonDen` be that full-season total for the player’s **primary team** (most snaps).

```
cumulativeSnapShare = sum(playerNum) / teamSeasonDen
```

**Injury adjustment:** After the base load is computed, we optionally **shrink the denominator** using nflverse injury data (`injuryReportWeeks` on the season). Let `missedGames = max(0, teamGames - gamesPlayed)` and `excusedWeeks = min(injuryReportWeeks, missedGames)`. We subtract `excusedWeeks × (teamSeasonDen / gameCount)` where `gameCount` is the number of distinct games that franchise played in `snap_counts`. That approximates “weeks missed while on the injury report” without penalizing load for those absences as harshly as healthy scratches. Applied only for single-franchise seasons when merging draft output (`resolveCumulativeLoadShareWithInjury`).

**Cap vs Avg snap:** Full-season + injury math can still produce a load **above** average weekly role share. We set `cumulativeSnapShare = min(computedLoad, snapShare)` when storing JSON and in `snapShareForRoleTier`, so Load never exceeds **Avg snap** (typical usage when active).

**Multi-team seasons (traded mid-year):** If the player appears on more than one franchise in `snap_counts` for that year, fall back to the **games-played** ratio: `sum(playerNum) / sum(teamDen per game row)` so we do not attribute one team’s full-season denominator to snaps earned with another club. Injury adjustment is **not** applied (no `loadMeta`).

**Implementation:** `scripts/update-data.ts`, `buildTeamSeasonDenominatorTotals`, `injuryAdjustedFullSeasonDenominator`, and `resolveCumulativeLoadShareWithInjury` in `src/lib/teamSeasonDenominator.ts`; per-game helpers in `src/lib/snapCountTotals.ts`. Stored as `cumulativeSnapShare` on each `Season`.

**Range:** 0.0–1.0 (values above 1.0 are not expected but would clamp in display if ever needed).

### 1.3 Games Played (per season, per player)

**Definition:** Count of games in which the player had at least one snap (offense + defense + ST > 0).

**Source:** Accumulated per-game in snap_counts data. Each row with `snaps > 0` increments the count.

### 1.4 Team Games (per season)

**Definition:** Number of games the **relevant franchise** played that NFL season (regular season **and** postseason), used as the denominator for `gamesPlayedShare`. Counts come from distinct `game_id` rows per team in nflverse `snap_counts` (same source as cumulative load `gameCount`).

**Resolution (in script, `resolveTeamGamesDenominator`):**

1. Primary team from snap data (most snaps that season), if known
2. Else injury-report primary team
3. Else drafting franchise
4. Else `max` franchise game count in that season’s file (at least 1)

**Behavior:**

- Playoff games are included so `gamesPlayed` and `teamGames` stay aligned (e.g. 20/20 for a full Bills season with three playoff games).
- Pre-2021 seasons still reflect the schedule length in the data (16-game regular seasons, plus any postseason for that franchise).
- For ongoing/incomplete seasons: each franchise’s count reflects games played so far in `snap_counts`.

### 1.5 Retention (per season, per player)

**Definition:** Player is considered retained if their primary team (by snap count) matches the drafting franchise.

**Primary team:** Team for which the player accumulated the most snaps in that season. Derived from `teamSnaps` in snap data (or injury report team when no snap data exists).

**Franchise normalization:**

| Old ID | Current ID |
| ------ | ---------- |
| STL    | LAR        |
| LA     | LAR        |
| SD     | LAC        |
| OAK    | LV         |
| LVR    | LV         |

**Logic:**

1. If snap data exists: `retained = (normalize(primaryTeam) === teamId)`
2. If no snap data but injury report exists: use injury report team as primary
3. If neither: infer from previous/next season primary team (player on roster but inactive)

---

## 2. Games Played Share

**Formula:**

```
gamesPlayedShare = gamesPlayed / teamGames
```

**Range:** 0.0–1.0+ (can exceed 1.0 if a player appears in more games than team total, e.g., traded mid-season)

**Usage:** Input to role classification. Combined with **effective tier share** from `snapShareForRoleTier(season, position)` — for most players this is cumulative load (capped at `Season.snapShare` when needed); for K/P/LS it is `Season.snapShare`.

---

## 2.5 Position-Adjusted Snap Share

**Purpose:** Snap share is not comparable across positions. A full-time offensive lineman plays ~100% of snaps; a lead running back rotates at ~50–65%; a rotational defensive tackle who is unambiguously a starter plays ~45–60%. Applying one absolute Core Starter bar (65%) to all of them made that bar sit at roughly the **15th percentile for QBs** and the **90th percentile for RBs** — about six times harder to clear depending on where a player lines up. To fix this, the effective tier share is divided by a **per-position baseline** before classification and scoring.

**Baseline:** For each position, the snap share of a clearly full-time starter — the **p90** of "qualifying" seasons (those with `gamesPlayed / teamGames >= 0.5`, so we measure role size rather than injury absence). Baselines are derived from the actual draft dataset by `scripts/derive-position-baselines.ts` and stored in `src/data/position-baselines.json` (a committed, refreshable artifact regenerated during `pnpm update-data`, before the rankings).

```
normalizedShare = min( snapShareForRoleTier(season, position) / BASELINE[position], 1 )
```

The result is "share of a full-time starter's workload at this position," clamped to 1. It replaces the raw share everywhere role classification (§3) and the continuous 0–100 season score (`getSeasonScore`, §7) consume it — both funnel through `snapShareForRoleTier`, the single choke point that applies the division.

**Exemptions (baseline = 1, i.e. no rescaling):**

- **Kickers, punters, long snappers.** Snap share is measured against a scrimmage-shaped denominator and does not describe speciakload at all, so normalizing it would be meaningless. They keep raw shares and their existing Significant Contributor carve-out (§3, SCmin = 0.32).list wor
- **Unknown positions** and any position with fewer than 25 qualifying seasons in the dataset. These fall back to a baseline of 1.0, reproducing the pre-adjustment behaviour.

**Effect on interior OL and QB:** their baselines are ~0.99–1.0, so their scores are essentially unchanged. The correction lifts under-credited rotational positions (DT, DL, RB, DE, TE) without moving the positions the old absolute bars already fit.

**Derivation parameters** live in `src/lib/positionBaseline.ts` (`BASELINE_PERCENTILE`, `QUALIFYING_GAMES_SHARE`, `MIN_QUALIFYING_SEASONS`, `BASELINE_FLOOR`) and are shared by the derivation script. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-17-position-adjusted-snap-scoring-research.md` for the full analysis, the measured per-team ranking shifts, and the open questions this design settled.

## 3. Role Classification (per season)

**Function:** `classifyRole(effectiveShare, gamesPlayedShare, gamesPlayed, position?)` in `src/lib/classifyRole.ts`. The first argument is **`snapShareForRoleTier(season, position)`** (stored season load when appropriate, else average share for legacy JSON; kickers/punters/long snappers use `snapShare`), **position-adjusted** by dividing by the per-position baseline (§2.5) for non-exempt positions. Optional **`position`** selects the Significant Contributor floor: **0.35** by default, **0.32** for K/P/LS. The **`gamesPlayed`** argument is retained for call-site compatibility and is not used in classification.

Classification uses a **first-match-wins** order. All thresholds use `>=` (inclusive).

### 3.1 Classification Table

First-match evaluation in `classifyRole` (see `src/lib/classifyRole.ts`). Let **SCmin** = **0.32** for kickers, punters, long snappers and **0.35** for all other positions.

| Order | Condition                                                   | Role                    |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1     | `cumulativeSnapShare >= 0.65` AND `gamesPlayedShare >= 0.5` | Core Starter            |
| 2     | `cumulativeSnapShare >= 0.65` AND `gamesPlayedShare < 0.5`  | Starter When Healthy    |
| 3     | `cumulativeSnapShare >= SCmin`                              | Significant Contributor |
| 4     | `cumulativeSnapShare >= 0.2`                                | Contributor             |
| 5     | `cumulativeSnapShare >= 0.1`                                | Depth                   |
| 6     | (else)                                                      | Non-Contributor         |

Steps 4–6 apply after any earlier branch fails (e.g. `cumulativeSnapShare` below **SCmin** but still `>= 0.2`).

### 3.2 Threshold Summary

| Role                    | cumulativeSnapShare                      | gamesPlayedShare | gamesPlayed |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Core Starter            | ≥ 0.65                                   | ≥ 0.5            | —           |
| Starter When Healthy    | ≥ 0.65                                   | < 0.5            | —           |
| Significant Contributor | ≥ **0.35** (most) or **≥ 0.32** (K/P/LS) | —                | —           |
| Contributor             | [0.20, SCmin)                            | —                | —           |
| Depth                   | [0.10, 0.20)                             | —                | —           |
| Non-Contributor         | < 0.10                                   | —                | —           |

### 3.3 Edge Cases

- **cumulativeSnapShare = 0, teamGames = 0:** `gamesPlayedShare` is 0; role = `non_contributor`
- **cumulativeSnapShare = 0.65, gamesPlayedShare = 0.5:** Exactly on boundary → `core_starter`
- **cumulativeSnapShare = 0.649:** Fails first two checks → `significant_contributor`

---

## 4. Player Overall Role (across seasons)

**Functions:** `getPlayerAverageScoreWeight`, `getPlayerRole` in `src/lib/getPlayerRole.ts`

**Definition:** Each season gets a **score weight** (0–4) from its classified role. The pick’s **draft value** is the **mean** of those weights across in-scope seasons. **Overall role** (UI badge, filters, draft-class counts) maps that mean to a representative `Role`, with thresholds at 0.5 / 1.5 / 2.5 / 3.5 on the 0–4 scale. If the mean is in the top band (≥ 3.5), Core Starter vs Starter when healthy is taken from the **peak** single-season role so both weight-4 roles stay distinguishable.

### 4.1 Role Hierarchy (low to high)

Used for peak comparison and mapping; score weights collapse the two starter roles to 4.

1. Non-Contributor
2. Depth
3. Contributor
4. Significant Contributor
5. Starter When Healthy
6. Core Starter

### 4.2 Algorithm

1. **Season filter:** If `draftingTeamOnly` is true, only consider seasons where `retained === true`.
2. **Per season:** `classifyRole` → map to score weight via `ROLE_SCORE_WEIGHTS`.
3. **Mean:** Average weight across those seasons (`getPlayerAverageScoreWeight`).
4. **Representative role:** Map mean to Non-Contributor / Depth / Contributor / Significant Contributor, or (if mean ≥ 3.5) use peak season among `{core_starter, starter_when_healthy}` (`getPlayerRole`).

### 4.3 Option: draftingTeamOnly

When true, only seasons where the player was retained (on drafting team) count toward the mean and peak. Useful to measure contribution _to the drafting team_ rather than career totals elsewhere.

---

## 5. Role Weights (for scoring)

| Role                    | Weight |
| ----------------------- | ------ |
| Core Starter            | 4      |
| Starter When Healthy    | 4      |
| Significant Contributor | 3      |
| Contributor             | 2      |
| Depth                   | 1      |
| Non-Contributor         | 0      |

---

## 6. Draft Class Metrics

**Function:** `getDraftClassMetrics(draft, teamId, options)` in `src/lib/getDraftClassMetrics.ts`

**Scope:** All picks by the given `teamId` in the given `draft` (single year).

### 6.1 Counts

| Metric                      | Definition                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| totalPicks                  | Number of picks by the team in that draft                                           |
| coreStarterCount            | Picks with overall role = Core Starter                                              |
| starterWhenHealthyCount     | Picks with overall role = Starter When Healthy                                      |
| significantContributorCount | Picks with overall role = Significant Contributor                                   |
| contributorRoleCount        | Picks with overall role = Contributor                                               |
| depthCount                  | Picks with overall role = Depth                                                     |
| nonContributorCount         | Picks with overall role = Non-Contributor                                           |
| contributorCount            | core_starter + starter_when_healthy + significant_contributor + contributor + depth |
| retentionCount              | Picks where `retained === true` in most recent season                               |

### 6.2 Rates

All rates are fractions (0–1). Division by zero yields 0.

| Rate            | Formula                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| coreStarterRate | `coreStarterCount / totalPicks` |
| contributorRate | `contributorCount / totalPicks` |
| retentionRate   | `retentionCount / totalPicks`   |

### 6.3 Retention (per pick)

Retention for metrics uses the **most recent season** only:

- Sort seasons by `year` descending
- `retained = latestSeason.retained ?? false`

---

## 7. Rolling draft score

**Function:** `getRollingDraftScore(draftClasses, teamId, options)` in `src/lib/getRollingDraftScore.ts`

**Scope:** All picks by the team across the provided draft classes (the app’s selected season span).

### 7.1 Score Formula

```
score = sum(player role weight) / totalPicks
```

Where:

- **Player role weight:** The mean of that pick’s per-season weights (see §4), not the representative overall role alone.
- **totalPicks:** Total number of picks by the team across all draft classes.

**Range:** 0.0–4.0 (all Core Starter seasons → 4.0 per season mean; all Non-Contributors → 0.0)

### 7.2 Auxiliary Metrics

| Metric          | Formula                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| coreStarterRate | `coreStarterCount / totalPicks` |
| retentionRate   | `retentionCount / totalPicks`   |

Same retention logic as draft class metrics (most recent season per pick).

### 7.3 Example

Team drafts 10 players across 5 years:

- 2 Core Starters (4 each) → 8
- 3 Significant Contributors (3 each) → 9
- 2 Depth (1 each) → 2
- 3 Non-Contributors (0 each) → 0

Score = (8 + 9 + 2 + 0) / 10 = **1.9**

---

## 8. Contributor Definition

**Contributor** = any non-zero role:

- Core Starter
- Starter When Healthy
- Significant Contributor
- Depth

**Non-Contributor** is excluded from contributor count.
