# Fix PR Review Issues

Fix all issues from the current PR: CI/CD failures, CodeRabbit comments, SonarCloud issues, Codecov coverage, and human reviewer feedback.

## Order of Checking

When fixing a PR, check these in order:

1. **CI/CD checks** (must all pass)
2. **CodeRabbit review comments** (address all non-nitpick issues)
3. **SonarCloud issues** (fix code smells, bugs, security issues)
4. **Codecov** (ensure coverage thresholds are met)
5. **Human reviewer comments** (if any)

## Instructions

1. Get the current branch and find the associated PR:

   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   gh pr view --json number,url
   ```

2. Check CI/CD status first:

   ```bash
   gh pr checks {pr_number} --repo ttu/nfl-draft-success
   ```

3. Fetch CodeRabbit review comments from the PR:

   ```bash
   # Get CodeRabbit inline review comments (code suggestions) - use --paginate for PRs with many comments
   gh api --paginate "repos/ttu/nfl-draft-success/pulls/{pr_number}/comments" \
     --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login == "coderabbitai[bot]") | {path: .path, line: .line, body: .body}]'

   # Count total CodeRabbit comments
   gh api --paginate "repos/ttu/nfl-draft-success/pulls/{pr_number}/comments" \
     --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login == "coderabbitai[bot]")] | length'

   # Get CodeRabbit summary comment from issue comments (get latest by created_at)
   gh api --paginate "repos/ttu/nfl-draft-success/issues/{pr_number}/comments" \
     --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login == "coderabbitai[bot]")] | sort_by(.created_at) | last | .body' | head -500
   ```

4. Parse the CodeRabbit comments and identify actionable issues:
   - Bot username is **"coderabbitai[bot]"** (not "coderabbitai")
   - Review comments are in PR comments API (`/pulls/{pr_number}/comments`)
   - Summary is in issue comments API (`/issues/{pr_number}/comments`)
   - Ignore comments where body contains "✅" as they are already resolved
   - Focus on issues marked with severity indicators:
     - 🟠 Major - Should fix
     - 🟡 Minor - Nice to fix
   - Look for `<details><summary>🛠️` sections for suggested fixes

5. Check SonarCloud issues:

   ```bash
   # Fetch all SonarCloud issues for the PR via API
   # Use WebFetch tool with this URL:
   # https://sonarcloud.io/api/issues/search?componentKeys=ttu_nfl-draft-success&pullRequest={pr_number}&resolved=false
   ```

   - Use WebFetch to get the JSON response and parse all issues
   - Each issue has: severity (BLOCKER, CRITICAL, MAJOR, MINOR, INFO), type (BUG, VULNERABILITY, CODE_SMELL), file path, line number, and message
   - Or visit web UI: `https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=ttu_nfl-draft-success&pullRequest={pr_number}`
   - Fix issues by priority: BLOCKER > CRITICAL > MAJOR > MINOR
   - Common fixes:
     - `window.X` → `globalThis.X` (prefer globalThis)
     - `parseInt()` → `Number.parseInt()` (use Number methods)
     - `str.replace(/g/)` → `str.replaceAll()` (use replaceAll for global)
     - Add `readonly` to interface props
     - Remove unnecessary character class brackets in regex `[X]` → `X`
   - Union type overrides (e.g., `StandardCategoryId | string`) may be intentional - skip if by design

6. Check Codecov coverage:
   - Check the Codecov link from `gh pr checks` output
   - Look for comments from "codecov" bot
   - Identify files with decreased coverage or uncovered lines
   - Check if new code needs additional tests

7. Check human reviewer comments:

   ```bash
   # List all commenters to identify humans vs bots
   gh api "repos/ttu/nfl-draft-success/issues/{pr_number}/comments" \
     --jq '[.[].user.login] | unique'

   # Get non-bot comments (filter out known bots)
   gh api "repos/ttu/nfl-draft-success/issues/{pr_number}/comments" \
     --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login | IN("coderabbitai[bot]", "codecov[bot]", "sonarqubecloud[bot]", "github-actions[bot]") | not)]'
   ```

   - Address requested changes from human reviewers

8. For each issue:
   - Read the relevant file
   - Understand the suggested fix
   - Apply the fix
   - Mark the issue as addressed in your response

9. After fixing all issues:
   - Run `/verify quick` to check lint and types
   - Commit the fixes with appropriate message:
     - `fix: address CodeRabbit review feedback` for CodeRabbit issues
     - `test: improve coverage for <area>` for Codecov issues
     - `fix: address SonarCloud issues` for SonarCloud issues
     - `fix: address review feedback` if fixing multiple sources
   - Optionally run `/verify` for full verification if requested

## Resolving Comments We Won't Fix

For CodeRabbit comments that won't be addressed, reply with an explanation so they're marked as resolved:

1. Get comment IDs with context:

   ```bash
   gh api "repos/ttu/nfl-draft-success/pulls/{pr_number}/comments" \
     --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login == "coderabbitai[bot]") | {id: .id, path: .path, line: .line, body: (.body | split("\n")[0:2] | join(" "))}]'
   ```

2. Reply to a comment explaining why it won't be fixed:

   ```bash
   gh api "repos/ttu/nfl-draft-success/pulls/{pr_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies" \
     -f body="Won't fix: <explanation>"
   ```

3. Common reasons for not fixing:
   - **Planning docs**: "This is a planning document. Markdown lint for docs/plans/ is not enforced in CI."
   - **Test patterns**: "The current test pattern works correctly and is consistent with the codebase."
   - **Design decisions**: "This is a deliberate design choice for <reason>."
   - **Future work**: "Won't fix in this PR. This requires significant refactoring and can be addressed in a separate PR."
   - **Nice-to-have**: "Nice-to-have but not required. The component has comprehensive test coverage."

## Safety Rules

- **NEVER** perform git write operations on `main` branch
- Always verify changes don't break existing functionality
- If a suggestion seems wrong or would break functionality, explain why and skip it

## Notes

- Group related fixes into logical commits if there are many changes
- If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a PR number, use that instead of the current branch's PR
- Report which issues were fixed and which were skipped (with reasons)
